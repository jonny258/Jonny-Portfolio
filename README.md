Welcome to my web development portfolio! This repository showcases my skills and projects as a web developer. Whether you're a potential employer, a curious developer, or just browsing, I hope you find this collection informative and inspiring.

This portfolio project showcases all my large projects, includes an about me section and a contact me section. It's designed to provide an overview of my work and experience, as well as a way for potential employers or clients to get in touch with me.
